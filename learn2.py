Sometimes youâ€™ll want to use the value of an item after you remove it from a
list. For example, you might want to get the x and y position of an alien that
was just shot down, so you can draw an explosion at that position. In a web
application, you might want to remove a user from a list of active members
and then add that user to a list of inactive members.
The pop() method removes the last item in a list, but it lets you work
with that item after removing it. The term pop comes from thinking of a
list as a stack of items and popping one item off the top of the stack. In
this analogy, the top of a stack corresponds to the end of a list.
